# Firstly, we create a client object.

# Secondly, we get information from LATOKEN.
# Checking server time
time = latoken.getServerTime()

# A lot of requests would require you submitting a currency id instead of the ticker (tag).

# You can combine websockets and rest api. They are implemented as one class.
